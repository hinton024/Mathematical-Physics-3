# Mathematical Physics - 3

In this course, We study

- Complex Analysis
- Fourier Transforms
- Laplace Transforms
- Dirac Delta Function

In practical we used computer programming to solve these physics problems - 

- Taylor Series Expansion of Sine and Cosine Functions
- Solve Boundary Value Problems Solution to Ordinary Differential equations using finite
Difference and shooting and Non Shooting methods
- Gauss Legendre, Gauss Lagaurre and Gauss
Hermite Integration methods to verify the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials and to solve other complex integrals.
- Representing Dirac delta function as a limiting sequence of functions and verify its properties
- Fourier Series Expansion and Evaluating the Fourier coefficients of a given periodic functions.
- Weighted Least square fitting
- Integral Transforms
